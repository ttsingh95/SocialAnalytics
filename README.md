#Social Engagement for Online Music Streaming 

The “freemium” business model is widely used by online services such as LinkedIn, Match.com, Dropbox, and music-listening sites like Spotify. It divides user populations into groups that use the service for free and groups that pay a fee for additional features. Key points related to the freemium model:
- Free accounts are monetized using online advertising
- Premium subscribers (those paying a fee) are typically 24 times more profitable than free users
- However, premium subscribers are rare

Some background about the Company: High Note is an anonymized real music streaming company - similar to Last.fm, Spotify or Pandora that uses a freemium business model.

The goal of this analysis is to use High Note's data in order to predict user's decision to buy using variables that fall under 'peer influence' and user engagement.' 
There are a lot of articles and research conducted which show that peer influence and user engagement can affect users’ decisions to pay for a premium subscription. Aim is to find out what variables influence users to shift from not paying to paying for the services offered on the streaming service.
The results will quantify the effect of social engagement on revenue, as well as how valuable a premium subscriber can be in a freemium social community.
